## Mining Turtles

### dig2x3Tunnel12Torch.lua

Digs a 2 block tall and 3 block wide tunnel and places torches every 12 blocks

#### TODO:
- build bridges when no blocks below
- better handling of gravel
- stop when inventory full or fuel level == 0
- change the way of breaking the first block in the loop
- return to initial position?
